I am a PhD Research Scholar working under the supervision of [Dr Venkatakrishnan Ramaswamy](http://brain.bits-hyderabad.ac.in/venkat/) at [BITS-Pilani Hyderabad](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/computerscience/ComputerScience), Telangana, India.


Deep learning approach in the field of artificial intelligence emphasizes high capacity, scalable models that have the capability to learn distributed representations from the input dataset. Although these models have outperformed humans as measured on the datasets in question, how they are able to do so remains unclear. The aim is to get better clarity on the **selectivity, discriminability, and ablation of neurons of neural networks** in order to understand deep learning models.

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked three months as Academic Associate in Information Systems, IIM-Ahmedabad. I graduated with a M.Tech (Distinction) in Computational Eng. Focus on AI & DS from Amrita School of Engineering, [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu/), Coimbatore,
India. In my M.Tech, I have worked on multiple projects related to Machine learning and deep learning applied to cyber security and bio-medical. My M.Tech thesis titled "**Deep Learning based Frameworks for cyber security applications**" under the supervision of [Dr K. P. Soman](https://www.amrita.edu/faculty/kp-soman/), Professor and Head, Center for Computational Engineering and Networking, Amrita School of Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India. Have also recieved B.E (Distinction) in Information Technology from Osmania University, Hyderabad, Telangana, India. My research interests include **machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, image processing, explainable models, and neuron understanding**. I spend my free time playing and teaching field hockey.
